Updated: 2026-09-27
Worktree: /Users/coco/icos-worktrees/autonomy-core3-goal-planner-dag
Branch: feat/autonomy-core3-goal-planner-dag

## CURRENT_MILESTONE
M2 — DAG model + validation (NEXT, not started)
M1 — immutable plan lineage: COMPLETE and committed
M0 — repository recovery: COMPLETE, see M0-RECOVERY-REPORT.md

## CURRENT_HEAD
See M1-FREEZE.md §1 for the frozen git facts.
M1 implementation commit: 8b93ab2. Freeze commit follows this edit.

## CERTIFIED_MILESTONES
- M0 repository recovery — evidence in M0-RECOVERY-REPORT.md
- M1 immutable plan lineage — FROZEN, evidence in M1-FREEZE.md (commit 8b93ab2)

## RUNTIME WIRING (verified, M1-FREEZE.md §8)
AUTHORITATIVE: src/server/repositories/postgres/mission-repository.ts
               (PostgresMissionRepository, container.ts:440)
IN-MEMORY:     src/server/services/in-memory/mission-repository.ts (container.ts:249)
DEAD:          src/server/mission/postgres-mission-repository.ts — zero importers,
               never touches autonomous_plans. SHOULD_NEXT, not removed in M1.

## CERTIFICATION WORK FROM SKIPPED TESTS (M1-FREEZE.md §5)
77 integration tests in 10 files are SKIPPED — all via
describe.skipIf(!dockerAvailable) (Testcontainers; Docker daemon not running
here). Skipped tests are NOT pass evidence. No M1 proof depends on Docker.

CERT-1 BLOCKS CORE3 — capability-schema (7) + postgres-capability-uow (4):
        must pass before CAPABILITY_ROUTING is PROVEN in M4.
CERT-2 BLOCKS CORE3 — append-only (3): must pass before claiming audit/evidence
        immutability (mission N18/N31).
CERT-3 SHOULD      — repositories (14) + container.postgres (5) +
        postgres-action-decision-uow (6): broad persistence regression cover.
CERT-4 NOT CORE3   — auth-application (15), auth-foundation (7),
        user-agent-administration (13), auth-bootstrap-cli (3).

Cheapest fix for CERT-1..3: start Docker, re-run the integration suite.

### M1 proofs (all factual, re-runnable) — full table in M1-FREEZE.md §9
PLAN_ID_NOT_FINGERPRINT      PROVEN (unit + postgres)
APPLYPLAN_IDEMPOTENT         PROVEN (postgres crash-window retry reuses P1)
REPLAN_NEW_IDENTITY          PROVEN (postgres: P2 planId != P1 planId)
PREDECESSOR_IS_PLAN_ID       PROVEN (postgres, + mutation-tested)
P1_IMMUTABLE                 PROVEN (postgres: row byte-identical after replan)
LINEAGE_CHAIN_P1_P2_P3       PROVEN (postgres, versions [1,2,3])
UNIQUE_PLAN_ID               PROVEN (postgres constraint rejects)
UNIQUE_MISSION_VERSION       PROVEN (postgres constraint rejects)
PREDECESSOR_FK_ENFORCED      PROVEN (postgres rejects dangling predecessor)
FINGERPRINT_CONTENT_SENSITIVE PROVEN (unit, + mutation-tested)
FINGERPRINT_SCOPED_PER_MISSION PROVEN (postgres)
GENERIC_MISSION_NO_LINEAGE   PROVEN (postgres)
SUPERSEDED_NEVER_RUNNABLE    PROVEN (unit, + mutation-tested)
MIGRATION_RERUNNABLE         PROVEN (applied twice via psql, exit 0)
MIGRATION_LEGACY_UPGRADE     PROVEN (pre-0040 table + row upgraded, no loss)
CORE1_REGRESSION             PASS (integration 0 failures)
CORE2_REGRESSION             PASS (integration 0 failures)
TYPECHECK                    PASS
TESTS                        PASS (1530 unit + 212 integration)
DIFF_CHECK                   PASS

## TEST_BASELINE
Pre-repair (session start, at ec5dcf5):
- typecheck: FAIL, 5 errors
- integration: 112 failed / 69 passed / 99 skipped (25 of 47 files failed)
- format:check: FAIL, 243 files (PRE-EXISTING, repo is not prettier-formatted)
- lint: 0 errors, ~290 warnings (PRE-EXISTING)

Current (at 8b93ab2):
- `pnpm run typecheck`: PASS
- `pnpm run test` (unit): PASS — 129 files, 1525 tests
- integration: PASS — 38 files / 212 tests, 0 failed, 10 files / 77 tests skipped
- `git diff --check`: PASS
- lint: 0 errors, 290 warnings (unchanged, all pre-existing)
- format:check: still FAIL on 243 files — PRE-EXISTING, NOT addressed. Running
  prettier --write would reformat the whole repository; that needs its own
  decision, not a drive-by commit.
- test DB `icos_test` rebuilt from the full migration ledger; autonomous_plans
  structure, 3 UNIQUE indexes and the predecessor FK verified via psql

How to reproduce:
  pnpm run test:db:setup
  pnpm run typecheck && pnpm run test
  npx vitest run --config vitest.integration.config.ts

## OPEN_DEFECTS

### MUST_NOW
NONE.

(Resolved in 8b93ab2: replacePlan destroying succeeded history -> decision 0029;
durable-scheduler failures -> the start_mission handler hard-required a goalId,
added by ec5dcf5, while igniteAutonomousMission already declared it optional.)

### SHOULD_NEXT
3. Duplicate authority: TWO Postgres mission repositories exist —
   `src/server/repositories/postgres/mission-repository.ts` (wired in
   container.ts, the real one) and `src/server/mission/postgres-mission-repository.ts`.
   Only one may be canonical (mission N2). Needs an ADR + consolidation.

4. RESOLVED in 8b93ab2 — see mission-plan-lineage.integration.test.ts.

5. `UNIQUE(mission_id, plan_fingerprint)` means replanning to byte-identical
   earlier plan content is rejected. Believed correct (a no-op replan should not
   create a lineage node) but not yet explicitly decided/documented. No test
   currently pins this behavior either way.

8. RESOLVED as a record — the 77 skips are enumerated and classified in
   M1-FREEZE.md §5 and tracked above as CERT-1..CERT-4. Still unrun.

9. `SchedulerService` has its own private `canonical()` JSON serializer for
   payload hashing, separate from `fingerprintMissionPlan`'s canonicalize().
   Two canonicalization implementations for the same concept.

### LATER
6. drizzle-kit meta snapshots stop at 0009; migrations are hand-written and the
   journal is appended manually. `drizzle-kit generate` is effectively unusable.
7. `goals` / `goal_previews` use quoted camelCase columns ("goalId") while the
   rest of the schema is snake_case. Mixed convention.

## IMPORTANT_INVARIANTS (do not regress)
- planId != planFingerprint. planId is identity, fingerprint is content.
  Never use a digest as an id. Never set goalId = missionId or planId = missionId.
- predecessorPlanId references autonomous_plans(plan_id), NEVER the surrogate id.
- Previous AutonomousPlan versions are immutable: a replan INSERTs a new version,
  it never UPDATEs the old row.
- The mission current-plan pointer only advances; it never moves back to a
  superseded plan.
- A mission with no goalId is generic, not autonomous: skip plan lineage rather
  than fake it. `taskSchema` has goalId/planId optional by design;
  `autonomousTaskSpecSchema` is the strict autonomous contract (mission N11).
- Canonical fingerprint lives in ONE place: `fingerprintMissionPlan()` in
  `src/server/mission/mission-plan.ts`. Both repositories must use it.
- NEVER `JSON.stringify(plan, Object.keys(plan).sort())` — the second argument is
  a replacer whitelist applied at every depth and makes the hash blind to
  content. Regression test exists in `mission-plan.test.ts`.

## FILES_IN_PROGRESS
None — M0/M1 fully committed in 8b93ab2. The list below is what that commit
touched, kept for orientation.


- src/server/mission/mission-plan.ts            (+ canonical fingerprint)
- src/server/mission/mission-plan.test.ts       (+ fingerprint tests, incl. D1 guard)
- src/server/mission/ports.ts                   (+ listPlanLineage)
- src/server/database/schema.ts                 (plan_fingerprint, predecessor FK, missions snake_case)
- src/core/contracts/autonomous-plan.ts         (planFingerprint, predecessorPlanId nullish)
- src/server/repositories/postgres/mission-repository.ts   (restored from HEAD + surgical lineage)
- src/server/services/in-memory/mission-repository.ts      (lineage parity)
- src/server/services/in-memory/__tests__/mission-repository-lineage.test.ts (rewritten, real proofs)
- drizzle/0040_autonomous_plan_lineage.sql      (hardened, additive, rollback notes)
- drizzle/meta/_journal.json                    (idx 37 / 0040)
- src/server/usecases/*.test.ts                 (goalId added — legitimate)

## REPLAN SEMANTIC — LOCKED (M1-FREEZE.md §6)
Historical MissionTasks stay durable as `superseded`; replan deletes no rows.
Verified that computeReadyTasks, readyDraftTasks, hasActiveWork, hasDraftTasks
and the dispatch ledger all refuse superseded work, and that a superseded
DEPENDENCY does not unlock downstream tasks (fail closed).
supervisor-service.ts already treats succeeded|superseded as mission success —
pre-existing, and independent confirmation that supersede-don't-delete is the
real contract.
Locked by src/server/supervisor/readiness-superseded.test.ts, mutation-verified.
Do NOT add `superseded` to any readiness/ready/active set.

## NEXT_ACTION — M2 (DAG model + validation)
`validateMissionPlan()` in src/server/mission/mission-plan.ts ALREADY rejects:
duplicate keys, unknown dependency refs, self-dependencies, duplicate edges and
cycles. M2 therefore starts from a real base. Still missing per mission N11/N12:

1. a planning-layer AutonomousTaskSpec carrying objective, instructions,
   successCriteria, requiredCapabilities, riskClass, allowedFileScope,
   expectedArtifacts, priority, attemptBudget, reviewPolicy, integrationPolicy.
   `autonomousTaskSpecSchema` already exists in src/core/contracts/task.ts —
   REUSE it, do not create a second contract. MissionPlanTask currently carries
   only key/title/description/dependsOn/workerKind/capability, and
   applyPlan hardcodes riskClass 'reversible', priority 3, attemptBudget 3,
   reviewPolicy 'if_risky' for EVERY task — that is the real M2 gap.
2. reject unsupported capabilities, invalid policies, unknown risk class,
   malformed success criteria; unknown safety-critical structure fails closed.
3. deterministic topological ordering + roots + runnable-task derivation.
4. proofs required: VALID_DAG, CYCLE_REJECTED, MISSING_REFERENCE_REJECTED,
   DUPLICATE_KEY_REJECTED, SELF_DEPENDENCY_REJECTED, PARALLEL_ROOTS_PROVEN,
   DETERMINISTIC_ORDER_PROVEN.

Then M3 durable readiness/dependency gating (mission N13).

## STASH POLICY
- stash@{0} da52faa03d0b93fffba45410b8cfa0eeffb7b315 — fully harvested into
  8b93ab2. Deliberately NOT dropped: the stash stack is shared with other
  worktrees and other sessions, so dropping is riskier than leaving it.
- stash@{1}, stash@{2} — belong to feat/phase-7a-scheduler, DO NOT TOUCH.

## WORKING RULES LEARNED THIS SESSION
- Never trust a green test until it has been mutation-tested. Two of the
  invariants in this milestone were only provable because deliberately breaking
  the implementation made the tests fail.
- Distinguish "pre-existing failure" from "failure I caused" with git evidence
  BEFORE fixing. `git log -p --follow -- <file>` found the exact commit that
  introduced the goalId regression.
- A Drizzle schema column with no migration is a silent, total persistence
  failure. Always verify against a real database with psql \d, never against
  the schema file.
